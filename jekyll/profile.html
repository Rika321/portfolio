      I am a computer science student focusing on data science and machine
      learning. I have experience and interest in computer game making, music
      information retrieval, and software engineering as well. I will continue
      with computer science after my graduation. After graduation, I would like
      to work as a developer or researcher either in a company or in a graduate
      program.
